1. PAD Summary

* PAD-A: High risk of exceeded limits and high fluid end vibration.  ENG-12 shows high risk of exceeded limits and high engine oil and water temperatures. TRANS-12 shows high risk of exceeded limits and high transmission oil temperature.

* PAD-B: High risk of exceeded limits and high engine oil temperature on ENG-27.

* PAD-C: High risk of exceeded limits and high engine oil and water temperatures on ENG-34.


2. Component Risks

* ENG-12: HIGH severity - Exceeded limits, high engine oil temperature, and high engine water temperature. Requires immediate inspection due to multiple high-severity risks.
* ENG-27: HIGH severity - Exceeded limits and high engine oil temperature. Requires immediate inspection.
* ENG-34: HIGH severity - Exceeded limits and high engine oil and water temperatures. Requires immediate inspection.
* TRANS-12: HIGH severity - Exceeded limits and high transmission oil temperature. Requires immediate inspection.


3. Actions

* Inspect Now: ENG-12, ENG-27, ENG-34, TRANS-12
* Monitor:  engine_oil_pressure_psi (ENG-12, ENG-27, ENG-34), engine_load_pct (ENG-12, ENG-27, ENG-34), trans_oil_pressure_psi (TRANS-12), fluid_end_vibration_mms (PAD-A)
